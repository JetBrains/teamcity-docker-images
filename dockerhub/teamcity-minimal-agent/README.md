## TeamCity Minimal Build Agent

[<img src="http://jb.gg/badges/official.svg" height="20"/>](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

This is an official [JetBrains TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) minimal build agent image.

<img src="https://github.com/JetBrains/teamcity-docker-images/blob/master/logo/GitHub.png" height="20" align="center"/> More details about tags and components are [here](https://github.com/JetBrains/teamcity-docker-images/blob/master/context/generated/teamcity-minimal-agent.md).

The [TeamCity build agent](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/build-agent.html) connects to the TeamCity server and spawns the actual build processes.
You can use the ```jetbrains/teamcity-server``` image to run a TeamCity server.

This minimal image adds just a  TeamCity agent without any tools like VCS clients, etc. It is suitable for simple builds and can serve as a base for your custom images. For Java or .NET development we recommend using the default build agent image [jetbrains/teamcity-agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/jetbrains/teamcity-agent/).

## How to Use This Image

Pull the TeamCity minimal image from the Docker Hub Repository:

```
jetbrains/teamcity-minimal-agent
``` 
&nbsp;
and use the following command to start a container with TeamCity agent running inside 
a Linux container:

```
docker run -it -e SERVER_URL="<url to TeamCity server>"  \ 
    -v <path to agent config folder>:/data/teamcity_agent/conf  \      
    jetbrains/teamcity-minimal-agent
```
&nbsp;
or a Windows container:
```
docker run -it -e SERVER_URL="<url to TeamCity server>" 
    -v <path to agent config folder>:C:/BuildAgent/conf      
    jetbrains/teamcity-minimal-agent
```
&nbsp;
where
**<url to TeamCity server>** is the full URL for TeamCity server, accessible by the agent. Note that "localhost" will not generally not work as it will refer to the "localhost" inside the container.
**<path to agent config folder>** is the host machine directory to serve as the TeamCity agent config directory. We recommend providing this binding in order to persist the agent configuration, e.g. authorization on the server. Note that you should map a different folder for every new agent you create.
    
Since version 2020.1, TeamCity agent Docker images __run under a non-root user__. Refer to our [upgrade notes](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/upgrade-notes.html#UpgradeNotes-AgentDockerimagesrunundernon-rootuser) for information on possible affected use cases.

When you run the agent for the first time, you should authorize it via the TeamCity server UI: go to the **Unauthorized Agents** page in your browser. See [more details](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/build-agent.html).

All information about agent authorization is stored in agent's configuration folder. If you stop the container with the agent and then start a new one with the same config folder, the agent's name and authorization state will be preserved.

TeamCity agent does not need manual upgrade: it will upgrade itself automatically on connecting to an upgraded server.

### Agent Image Environment Variables

- **SERVER_URL** - URL of the TeamCity server agent will connect to
- **AGENT_NAME** - (optional) Name of the agent in TeamCity UI, autogenerated if omitted
- **AGENT_TOKEN** - (optional) Agent authorization token, if unset, the agent should be [authorized](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/build-agent.html#BuildAgent-BuildAgentStatus) via TeamCity UI.
- **OWN_ADDRESS** - (optional, linux only) IP address build agent binds to, autodetected  
- **OWN_PORT** - (optional, linux only) Port build agent binds to, 9090 by default  

### Windows Containers Limitations

The details on the known problems in Windows containers are available in the [TeamCity documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/known-issues.html#KnownIssues-WindowsDockerContainers).
 
## Customization

You can customize the image via the usual Docker procedure:

1. Run the image
```
docker run -it -e SERVER_URL="<url to TeamCity server>"  \ 
    -v <path to agent config folder>:/data/teamcity_agent/conf  \
    --name="my-customized-agent"  \
    jetbrains/teamcity-minimal-agent  \
```
2. Enter the container 
```
docker exec -it my-customized-agent bash
```

3. Change whatever you need
4. Exit and [create a new image](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/) from the container
```
docker commit my-customized-agent <the registry where you what to store the image>
```
